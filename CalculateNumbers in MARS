addi $v0, $zero, 5 #5 is for reading an int

move $s0, $v0 

# Calculate the result of 5*x*x + 2* x + 3 and store it in $s1. 
mul $t0, $s0, $s0 # this does x squared
mul $t0, $t0, $s0 # mult x squared by x to get x cubed
mul $t0, $t0, 10 #now $t0 is 10 x cubed
mul $t1, $s0, $s0 
mul $t1, $t1, 5 # $t1 is now 5 x squared
mul $t2, $s0, 2 #$t2 is 2 times x
add $t0, $t0, $t1 # $t0 is now 10 x cubed + 5 x squared
add $t0, $t0, $t2 # $t0 is now 10 x cubed + 5x squareed + 2x
addi $s1, $t0, 3  # Now the entire polynomial is saved in $s1

# Print output
